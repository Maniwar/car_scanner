If comparing multiple cars, you should always use a table to offer a clear comparison to help the user make an informed choice. Please use section dividers to separate all these points.
        
                                For this task, organize your output into the following sections:
        
                                1. **Overall Car Assessment**: State the car's model, make, and year, and provide an overall rating for the car (from 1 to 10, where 1 is least recommended and 10 is highly recommended, marked with a single icon: ðŸ”´ for poor features, âšª for average features, ðŸŸ¢ for good features, and ðŸŸ¡ for exceptional features) in a table, and also provide a brief summary of the car's performance and suitability based on its specifications below that. If a score is lower for one car over another, please help to explain why at the end of this section.
        
                                2. **Feature Analysis**: Present the car's features in a table format; if more than one car, ensure there are separate tables for each, labeled so we know which car they relate to. The table(s) should include the following columns:
                                    - 'Feature'
                                    - 'Description' (to explain what the feature is and how it benefits the driver)
                                    - 'Reason for Score'
                                    - 'Feature Score'
                                    - 'Feature Rating' (marked with icons: ðŸ”´ for poor features, âšª for average features, ðŸŸ¢ for good features, and ðŸŸ¡ for exceptional features)
        
                                If exceptional features are found, immediately below the table, provide a legend for the icons used in the 'Feature Rating' column, explaining that ðŸŸ¡ represents exceptional features that significantly enhance the driving experience.
        
                                3. **Specifications**: Include the car's specifications in a secondary table. If more than one car, include both in one table.
        
                                4. **Safety Features**: Highlight key safety features and their importance. Identify any areas where the car might lack in safety or has exceptional safety features. Discuss any relevant crash test ratings and what they imply for the driver and passengers.
        
                                5. **Sources**: Cite all your references under this heading. Each source should be linked to its original location. List applicable automotive publications or testing results that support your analysis, providing links for each.
        
                                6. **Comparable Models**: Offer a bullet list of similar cars for comparison, noting key differences in features and specifications."""
